<p>
  Visitors are welcome at the weekly group meeting, which will take place
  {{ site.data.hours.group_meeting }}.
</p>

<p>
  I generally expect to be around my office and open for research discussions
  with the group at least for these hours for the Fall:
</p>

<ul>
{% for hour in site.data.hours.group %}<li>{{ hour }}</li>{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>
  You can also schedule appointments using my
  <a href="https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/33d37e9c60e44e8ebbb4bb387be0c4fe@cornell.edu?anonymous&ep=plink">schedule online</a> or by email.
