<p>
  For Fall 2022, we will meet at a group Friday 9-10 in Gates 405. Visitors are
  welcome.  I will also be meeting with whoever wants to spend some time on MHD
  on Mondays, 4:30-5:30, in Gates 425.
</p>

<p>
  I generally expect to be around my office and open for research discussions
  with the group at least for these hours for the Fall:
</p>

<ul>
{% for hour in site.data.hours.group %}<li>{{ hour }}</li>{% endfor %}
</ul>

  You can also schedule appointments using my
