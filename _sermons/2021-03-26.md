No sermon today.  I started one, but it got too long and muddled.  Instead, I’ll just give my normal advice: get up and get outside this weekend if you can.  No amount of self-care and mindfulness is going to make this an easy year, but it’s easier to take things as they come if you can get proper rest and exercise.
