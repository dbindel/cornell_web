That’s more than enough official business for one mail.  So I’ll wrap up this
week with a snippet of another of Sandy Mack’s "sermons” from my undergrad days
(from Dec 16, 1997):

How to Handle Stress:

1. Pop some popcorn without putting a lid on it.
2. When someone says, "Have a nice day," tell them you have other plans.
3. Make a list of things to do that you have already done.
4. Dance naked in front of your pets.
5. Tape pictures of your teachers on watermelons and launch them from high places.
6. Walk to class backwards.
7. Read the dictionary upside down and look for hidden meanings.
8. Stare at people through the tines of a fork and pretend they are in jail.
9. Make up a language and ask people for directions in it.
10. Remember that when we next meet it will be a new year. With new chances for improvements. With new terrors. With new hope.

Have a great weekend.
