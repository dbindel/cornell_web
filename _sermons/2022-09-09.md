Applied math is what the label says.  You’re all learning to be
mathematicians.  You’re also, ideally, all learning about at least one
application area, and how to connect that to your mathematical expertise.  And
learning how to seriously connect math to applications is hard!  You need to
learn the vocabulary of the other areas; you need to pick up things that the
people around you learned as undergraduates; you need to build up from being a
beginner to knowing what’s going on, and sometimes you don’t have the benefit
of years of time and structured classes.

The good news: you are learning the math skills you need to get started.  And
the main thing you need to keep going is to not worry that you don’t know
what’s going on – it’s a challenge and an opportunity.  Put up your hand,
channel your inner three-year-old, and start asking “why” and “how” until you
get answers you can grab onto.  And when you’re stuck, sleep on it and try
again the next day.
