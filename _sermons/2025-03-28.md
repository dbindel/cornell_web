Let’s keep it short and sweet this week: For those of you who will be around
during the break, I hope you still have some down time planned.  We all need
this sometimes, along with needing adequate food and water, social interaction,
physical activity, and sleep.  This is not sufficient for progress, but it is
necessary.
 
Wishing you all a good break – and if you’re around Ithaca, I look forward to
seeing you in the coming week!
