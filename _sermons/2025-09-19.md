Well, you’ve made it through the first month of classes (or at least the first
four weeks).
 
I hope you are settled into a steady rhythm, whether it is in your classes,
your teaching, or your semester’s research plans.  I hope, too, that you are
taking the occasional moment to reflect on your goals and planning.  That means
making sure that you’re taking enough time for things that are important to
your career – are you getting some research done in between your classes and
teaching? – and also making sure that you’re taking enough time for the things
that keep you happy, healthy, and resilient in the face of the expected ups and
downs of life.  That means getting enough food, sleep, exercise, and social
activity, as I often start to emphasize around this time of year.  It also
means time spent on adulting: you need to buy groceries, see the doctor, and
file your taxes and other paperwork, just like the rest of us.  And sometimes,
it also means having a network and a plan for how to deal with the expected
unexpected: when you get sick, when there is a family emergency, or when life
just goes a bit sideways.  We all have troubles, and we all fall down.  Being
an adult means dealing with that and moving forward.  And being part of a
community means that sometimes we get to help each other back up.  Be kind to
yourselves, be good to each other, and make sure you take the time to enjoy the
little things when they are in front of you.
