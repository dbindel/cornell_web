First, I want to acknowledge that this time of year is a crunch time for a lot
of us, faculty and students alike.  You’ve got this – which is to say, I wish
you many successes, and to meet the failures that happen from time to time with
equanimity.  All of us stumble, and a lot of life is just about incorporating
those stumbles into your stride.

Second – I was getting ready to send this when I heard about the Rittenhouse
verdict.  I am angry and disappointed, and a little bewildered and numb.  I
wish I was shocked.  Some of you may feel the same, or more so.  Some of you
may just not have been following.  But I assure you that if you are teaching,
you have students for whom this is going to land hard.  Take care for each
other.  Talk to me if needed.

Given the season we’re entering, I wanted to say a few words about community
and service.  But that might be a discussion for the next week.
