We learn from the past, and we plan for the future.  At least, we try to plan
for the future – that’s harder when everything is up in the air.
 
But while we’re pondering the past and planning ahead, we live in the present.
And in the present, you’re at Cornell.  You’re in a community that I’m proud to
be associated with – I think you’re great, I brag about you when I’m given the
opportunity, and I get excited when good things happen for you.  And you do the
same for each other, which is not to be underestimated!  You may be looking at
a wet and gray sky right now, but we’re close to spring… the signs are all
there.  And if you look around, I am sure you will find lots of other good
things in the world, too.
 
Take care of yourself, take care of each other, and take in the good things.
We can’t spend all our time planning against the worst.
