I happen to live downtown close to an elementary school.  One of the school
crossing guards stands right across the street from us in the morning.  So on
days when it snows, I get up a little bit earlier to go outside, sweep the
snow off our steps, and shovel up and down the block.  I try to get out early
enough so that the kids walking past are walking on pavement with good
traction, and also so that not too many people have walked over it and packed
it down.  We usually don’t get so much snow that it takes long.  It gives me
a little exercise, and I’m in with plenty of time for the kids breakfast and
my morning coffee before they head out.
 
Lots of people dream of changing the world.  And often those dreams are so
big that it’s not clear where to start!  But there are lots of small things
that you do that make your communities a little better: shoveling the walk,
doing the dishes, bringing food to a family with a new kid, saying hello to
the neighbors.  If the news of the day gets to be too much and you want to
push back against it in some way, it doesn’t always take a lot.  Just put
down the phone and pick up a shovel for a few minutes.
