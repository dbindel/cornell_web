It has been another terrible week in the news, and many of you are facing
additional, personal hardships.  It’s a lot sometimes.  I’ve taken to dealing
with that by sitting with our bunny rabbits and watching their antics (and
sometimes they nibble on my toes).  It doesn’t make the world any better, but
it at least cheers me up.

It promises to be beautiful weather here in Ithaca this weekend.  I hope those
of you who are in town have the chance to enjoy it.  For those of you
elsewhere, I still hope you have the chance to take a break this weekend.
