Get your flu shot.  Make a plan to vote, if you’re eligible.  Go outside and
get some exercise.  Get some sleep.  Celebrate your victories.  Talk to a
friend.  You know a lot of the things that you need to do in order to keep
yourself and your circle moving forward.  Take some time today to do them.
 Yes, that homework, paper deadline, etc is important, but you’ll be able to
deal with these things more effectively if you are also able to take the time
to take care of yourselves.
