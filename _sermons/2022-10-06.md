A thought to take you into the break: I have enormous admiration for all of
you.  You came here to a new place, willing to try this new thing called
graduate school, and you’ve worked at it hard!  And yes, you are here to learn
to do good research, and you’re doing that -- but many of you are equally
devoted to just doing good, and that makes me happy as well.  You’re learning
to answer some questions and ask lots of others, and you’re curious enough
about the world that you’ll probably always have more questions than answers.
You focus, pay attention, and learn an enormous mathematical vocabulary over
time – and you don’t stop there, but turn outward and learn about all sorts of
other things as well!  And while we’re all sometimes sad, it makes me happy how
often I see you be joyous, be silly, be profound.  You are awesome, and I’m
glad you are here.
