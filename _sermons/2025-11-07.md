As for a sermon:  Let’s make it three small bites this week.
 
First, a quote, this week from Epictetus: "If you want to improve, be
content to be thought foolish and stupid."
 
Second, a reminder: you are each others’ keepers, and you have more
power than you know to improve the life of your community just by paying
attention and checking in on your fellows.
 
And third, an observation: we are creatures of habit, and you are
mathematicians in an R1 university.  So make doing math a part of your
habits.  A consistent bit of progress every day will take you a long
way, even if each day feels like you only made a small step.
