Let’s keep it short and sweet this time.
 
Many of you have lots of things on your plate, particularly this time of year.
And you mostly already know this, but I will remind you anyhow: the way you get
things done is to do them.  Get started, do a good job, and then put it to
rest.  You still need food, sleep, exercise, and social activity to be
effective – don’t skip those things!  But everything builds on consistent,
one-step-at-a-time progress.
 
Also: take five minutes now and then to give a pep talk to someone who might
need it?  Or share a meal, or have a cup of tea or a coffee together.  It won’t
cure all the ails of the world, nor will it get rid of tasks on your plate, but
maybe it will make you both feel better and more prepared to tackle what’s in
front of you.
