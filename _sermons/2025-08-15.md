Every semester, I find myself reminding students that they need food, sleep,
exercise, and social activity – and please do plan on reserving some time for
these things as you are planning out your semester!  But for the first message
of the new school year, I’d like to be a little more aspirational than that.
We take care of the basics so that we have the foundation for doing all that is
exciting in a research environment: learning new things and passing that
knowledge on to others, whether by writing a paper or teaching a class.  I wish
for all of you a year of working hard, playing hard, and pushing the limits of
what we all know in directions that none of us would have imagined.  Go, do
good math, and use it to help us all to do new things and to understand the
world a little better and a little more deeply.  This is, after all, why all of
us are here.
