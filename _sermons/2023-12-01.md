The end of the calendar year brings a lot of happy things, but can also bring a
lot of stress.  Know the signs of when you are getting stressed out, and how
you deal with it.  Food, exercise, and social activities help sometimes; or you
may de-stress by folding paperclips into the shapes of small animals.  Whatever
works for you, just be attentive to your own state.  And repeating a theme: you
are each othersâ€™ keepers.  If you think you see someone around you suffering,
do reach out.
