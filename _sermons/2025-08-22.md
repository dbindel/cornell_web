You can do hard things.  And you are here to do hard things!  That may mean
learning something new without the support of a class, jumping into an
application area where you have no undergraduate courses, or diving deeply into
an area of mathematics until you are probing the research frontier.  Doing hard
things sometimes means working hard, but it mostly means doing work that is a
bit uncomfortable, because it is stretching you in new directions.  If you
always know where you’re going, you may want to be more ambitious – per the
Einstein quote, "if we knew what we were doing it wouldn’t be research."
 
Have a great final weekend of summer – and I’m looking forward to seeing what
hard things you accomplish this semester!
