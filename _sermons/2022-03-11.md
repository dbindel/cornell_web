We’re halfway there!  (Woah, living on a prayer…)
 
The halfway point of the spring semester is often a pretty stressful
time.  It’s midterm time for some classes; spring is coming, but the
weather hasn’t turned around yet; and everyone is feeling ready for a
break – but it won’t arrive for another couple weeks.
 
But: spring *is* coming (and so is spring break).  Days are getting
longer.  You’re working hard, but there is a payoff in learning cool
stuff.  And I hope you feel like you’re getting the support you need
to succeed even in the middle of the semester.  If you need help (or
just want to talk things through), you know where to find me and Phil.
And please *do* talk to us if you have concerns – as with vehicles and
medical care, preventive maintenance saves everyone a lot of time in
the long run.
