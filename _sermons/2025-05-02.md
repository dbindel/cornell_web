The semester is ending.  The return of regular warm weather is upon us.
Those of you still taking classes or TA-ing are surely faced with the usual
end-of-semester stresses; those of you who are just doing research right now
may be oblivious.  Either way, it is a time when lots of things are changing
over from the in-semester mode of operating to the summer mode of operating.
 
There’s often a sense of “almost there” in this transition, a rush to finish
off with finals and move on to the next thing.  As for the exams themselves,
they often have a remarkable purgative effect on many minds: as soon as the
exam is done, the material is promptly forgotten in the hopes that it will
never be needed again.  Of course, even those of you tempted to treat the
end of the semester this way probably know in your heart that it is not
productive.  Many topics, from the purest theory to the most nuts-and-bolts
engineering, can inform and inspire an applied mathematician.  And you use
what you remember, and you remember what you use.  So as you wrap things up
this semester, I hope you’ll spend some time not in facetiously asking “when
am I ever going to use this again?” but in seriously asking “where in my
work could I see using this now, or soon?”  And more broadly, I hope you
spend some time at the end of this semester reflecting on your successes and
your trials, taking away what lessons you can before they are lost in the
end-of-semester rush.
