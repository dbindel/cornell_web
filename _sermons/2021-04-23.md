This was a trying week, in a trying semester, in a trying academic year.  But while I was staring at the ceiling and waiting for sleep last night, I thought for a bit about the AA prayer, the one that talks about “the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.”  It’s a good dichotomy for the current moment.
 
There’s a lot out there to accept, and there’s a lot out there to change.  But it’s hard to be wise about the difference when you’re exhausted.  So go take care of yourselves as best you can for the remaining three of these four days of break.  Get some sunshine, some exercise, a conversation with a friend.  Give yourself the break you need to be wise.
