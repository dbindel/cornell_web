There’s sometimes this feeling that as graduate students (or faculty, or...) we
should Already Know X, for many different X.  And sometimes there’s the fear
that if everyone around you knows X, you will feel foolish or be looked down
upon if you admit that you don’t know it.
 
I hope most of you know, intellectually, that the number of things that you
really truly Know is often pretty narrow (maybe there are more things that you
sort-of-know and could probably look up if needed).  But we’re usually pretty
bad about modeling that for other people.  This gets us into trouble when
teaching -- who here has given an explanation of something and gotten a
completely blank look from a friend or student who didn’t know the words being
used?  But it also gets us into trouble if we get intimidated into not
admitting that we don’t know something.  So this week, I encourage you to
cultivate the habit of saying “I don’t know X but would love to learn more!”
The only way to get to know a new topic is to start somewhere and learn things!
