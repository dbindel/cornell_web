Finally, a short start-of-semester sermon.  I usually write something in the
middle of the semester to the effect that you are each others’ keepers, and I
think that’s true.  But you are your own keeper, too!  That’s an important
thing to remember at the beginning of the semester when you are setting the
schedule for what is to come.  To the extent that a foot race is at all an
appropriate metaphor, research is a marathon and not a sprint – there will
always be a next exam and a next paper deadline, but your reputation is
determined by the arc of what you can learn and teach the world over a much
longer time span.  So start as you intend to proceed, set a sustainable pace of
work, and remember to schedule some of your time toward friends, food, hobbies,
exercise, and all the other things that keep you going.
