I have a job where I do things I like to do.  I play with math and computers,
sometimes getting others to join in, and then I get to tell students about the
stuff that I love.  I think this is great!  For me, the joy of it isn’t in
papers or prizes, it’s in the day-to-day figuring out.

There are lots of external milestones in undergraduate life: homework, quizzes,
exams, projects.  Most of them are on the time scale of semesters.  Grad school
has some milestones as well: finding an advisor and committee, A exam, B
exam.  But these milestones are fewer and farther apart.

As graduate students, by and large, you are responsible for structuring your
days and figuring out how to keep moving forward.  That’s not always a simple
task, even in less turbulent times!  And sometimes there is the temptation to
just bull forward with the concrete tasks that the world has set for you:
grading homework for your class, running experiments prior to a paper deadline,
doing the laundry and feeding the pets.  But while these are all important
things (certainly your pets think so!), I hope you all are able to take
advantage of the rare privilege of exploring what interests you, I wish for you
all the mental space to enjoy going to play with your research.
