I started to write something longer, but decided that I could say what I wanted with fewer words: Some of you, like me, may have ambitions to catch up after a crazy couple of weeks at the start of the semester.  I hope that this will not keep you from spending some time away from your computer screens as well.  March is when Ithaca starts to thaw out.  For those of you who can get outside, I encourage you to do so.  If you can see others while outside, all the better.
