I might be able to marshal my thoughts into a sermon next week, but for this
week I’d just like to point you to a resource that I think is useful, the
“mentor map” guide from the National Center for Faculty Development and
Diversity:

<https://www.facultydiversity.org/ncfddmentormap>

None of us enter new roles having it all figured out – indeed, academic life
consists largely of being thrown feet-first into situations where we have no
idea what we’re doing!  But we’re social creatures, and you can pick up a lot
of support and wisdom from asking the right questions of the right people in
your circles.  Everyone’s support network and needs will look a little
different; but thinking through who you have available to ask different types
of questions, and what types of questions you’re asking, is a good way to help
yourself stay centered and happy.
