Today’s inspiration is again borrowed from Sandy Mack (from
http://honcol.blogspot.com/2014/11/former-honors-director-sandy-mack-is.html):

> Committed realist or idealistic romantic — showing up alert, sane, and
> compassionate seems more and more to be at least Woody’s 85%, maybe more.
> 
> It’s thrilling — because there is almost always room for change, adjustment,
> repentance, improvement, ecstasy, magic.  It’s exhausting — because we never
> seem to outgrow the need to grow, fail, learn, and try again.

And isn’t that just the right note to start this semester?  We’re all making it
up as we go along, even more so than normal, and it is both thrilling and
exhausting.
