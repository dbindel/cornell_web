When I was a postdoc, I once asked a colleague if he knew an expert who might
be able to help me with a particular question in my broad area.  I considered
my colleague to be more knowledgeable than me about this thing, and so it
seemed to me at the time to be a reasonable question.  I was therefore a bit
surprised when he burst out laughing and said “I have no idea, David, and if
anyone else had asked me I would have told them to go ask you!”

It turned out that this “background question” maybe wasn’t such a background
question.  It turned into part of a research paper later.

Imposter syndrome is a real thing.  And it doesn’t necessarily go away with
experience!  It’s very easy for me to look at someone else and feel like a
fraud because they know X and I “only” know Y (for appropriate values of X and
Y).  On the other hand, I also have enough experience to be comfortable that
(a) when what I feel like disagrees with the evidence, my feelings may be
untrustworthy, and (b) I know enough to be able to pursue my interests, and I
have happily expansive opportunities to learn more as I go.

I’ve been happy with how our admissions process works, and I’m pretty sure all
of you also know enough to be able to pursue interesting mathematics.  However
you may feel at any given moment, you’re only truly an imposter if you pretend
to know things that you don’t know.
