A big, messy, ongoing election; in excess of 100K/day infections — what times
we live in.

Even in a normal year, this is around the time of the semester that lots starts
coming at everyone.  This year, of course, it’s easy to feel like the world is
happening to us, and we’re just trying to keep up.  For good or ill, none of us
are where we are without a good bit of luck playing a role.  But don’t
underestimate your own agency, either, and keep looking for chances to make the
world a little better, whether through your technical work or through a
kindness to a student, a friend, a random stranger.  Or, per Robert Louis
Stevenson: “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that
you plant.”
