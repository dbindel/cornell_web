Just a short thought today: The start of the semester often brings a measure of
excitement and a measure of terror.  But you’ve got this.  Go and do good work,
reach out if you need help or see someone who needs help, and remember that
mistakes need not be fatal (and if we knew what we were doing, we probably
wouldn’t be doing research!).
