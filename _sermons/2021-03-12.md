Cornell shut down for COVID on March 13, 2020, a year ago tomorrow.  We are in a better place now than we were than, in many ways.  We have a better notion of what we can do safely until there is a vaccine, and vaccinations are proceeding apace.  Eligibility letters for those of you who are eligible (anyone with on-campus duties, though in-person class as a student doesn’t count) should be available a couple days after you submit your attestations.  Get your vaccination when you can.  But while we all wait, stay safe.  You have all likely seen the modeling predictions – we are likely to have increased prevalence in the student body for the back half of the spring semester as the new strains arrive.  We expect things to remain under control, but we are not yet in the clear.
 
No sermon today, just my encouragement to you to hang in there.  We knew coming in that spring would be long, but at least we now have signs that spring is arriving.  It’s supposed to be clear tomorrow, if not as warm as it has been for the past few days; I hope you have a chance to go outside.  And remember to set your clocks forward on Sunday night.
