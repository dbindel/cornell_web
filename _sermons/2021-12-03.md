It’s a time of the year where everyone is getting crunched a little, so let me
remind you:

- Watch your sleep, diet, and exercise.  It’s hard to do your best if you’re
  tired, hungry, and haven’t moved from your computer all day.
- Keep your big picture in mind.  Sometimes you’ll have to choose between
  things you focus on, and that’s OK.
- It’s easy to fall into the trap at the end of the semester of only being in
  question-answering mode.  But remember: you’re here partly to learn how to
  ask questions, too!  Don’t let that get lost in the churn.
 
Good luck to all of you as we enter the semester end game.  And I’ll see you at
colloquium!
