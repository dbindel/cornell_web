The first news I read this morning was about the president’s COVID diagnosis.
 This came on the heels of diagnoses for people I care about rather more on
Thursday night, and other bad health news for my extended family earlier in the
week.  The combination reminded me that, though it’s harder with those I don’t
know and those I violently disagree with, I aspire to being able to wish
happiness and freedom from suffering to all.  In days of anger and upset,
finding compassion takes work - it’s easier to see disagreement than to see
common humanity.  But for all that, the effort to move toward compassion still
seems worthwhile, at least to me.
