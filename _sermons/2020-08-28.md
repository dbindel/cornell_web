This week we saw fires in California, hurricanes hitting Louisiana, COVID
deaths passing 180K, and the news of police shooting Jacob Blake in the back.
 The drumbeat of bad news is a constant background in 2020, but any given piece
of bad news is probably hitting some of us disproportionately hard.  For those
of you who are teaching this fall, that might be a student in your section.  Or
it might be a friend, or it might even be you.  And the year is not over, and
we know that there will be more bad news in store.  Fall will turn to winter
soon enough, and for many of us it gets harder to cope as the days get shorter
and colder.  This will, for many, be a hard year.

So what are we to do?  I have said it before, but it bears repeating: you are
your brother’s keeper.  Lean on those around you, and let them lean on you in
turn.  Schedule regular check-ins with your friends now, so that those routines
will be in place when trouble hits.  Learn about the formal and informal mental
health and counseling resources that Cornell offers.  And while I encourage you
to strive, to learn as much as you can, and to good research — also be gentle
with yourself, your friends, your students, and your mentors.

This is not a normal year, but we’re all in it together.  Good luck to all of
us in the coming week as we set to it.
