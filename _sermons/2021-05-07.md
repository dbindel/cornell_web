This year has been hard, and it has been hectic.  But I continue to find joy in the time that I’m able to sit down and think long thoughts: plans for projects and programs that I do not expect to wrap up within a month or two, but that I think are likely to engage me over years.  That is true of my research, of course, but it is also true of other things – like CAM.  And, as with most of my research, CAM is a long-term collaboration, both with the faculty and with all of you.
 
Summer is a great time to spend some dedicated time on long-term thinking, and one of the things I would really like to do this summer is to think through the types of things we can do together to make CAM a better place.  I have to write some of this up in the form of a graduate field manual, and I am looking forward to your thoughts about things that should go into that.  But more than just writing down a document that describes where we are, I hope to write where we want to go next.  What should we do more of?  What should we do less?  How can we best support each other?  What can we take from this COVID year that will make future years better?
 
I need your help with this, and I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
