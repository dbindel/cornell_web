Vaccinations are in sight, and we all hope to have a mostly-normal in-person academic experience next year.  For now, though, we have only just started with the marathon that I expect will be the spring semester.  I hope the semester might get easier in some ways, as the cold and snow creeps back and we get the first hints of spring.  But while we wait for those days, I thought it might be useful to share an adaptation of one of the old sermons that I got as an undergraduate, sent in mid-December of 1997 by Professor Sandy Mack (you can probably figure out for yourself which item I changed!).
 
How to Handle Stress:

1. Pop some popcorn without putting a lid on it.
2. When someone says, "Have a nice day," tell them you have other plans.
3. Make a list of things to do that you have already done.
4. Dance naked in front of your pets.
5. Tape pictures of your teachers on watermelons and launch them from high places.
6. Walk to class backwards.
7. Read the dictionary upside down and look for hidden meanings.
8. Stare at people through the tines of a fork and pretend they are in jail.
9. Make up a language and ask people for directions in it.
10. Remember that we only ever walk one step at a time, whether it is through the 14 weeks of the spring semester, through the course of a graduate program, or the course of life.  We can do remarkable things through steady progress and time.
