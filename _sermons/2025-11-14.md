No sermon today, just a general note of encouragement: we’re getting
into the home stretch of the semester, which often means a little extra
pressure.  But you’re all capable folks, and you know the drill at this
point in your life.  Good luck, and be good to each other!  And if you
need some encouragement, you don’t need any real excuse to make a time
to come talk to me.  If you want, I’m happy to make you tea and let you
read the book of pictures of cute animals on my office table.
