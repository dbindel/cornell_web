Last week we did announcements and no sermons.  This week, I’m on travel.  But
maybe let’s sneak in a quick sermon.
 
I learned yesterday that Howard Elman passed away earlier this week at the age
of 71.  Howard was at Maryland while I was an undergraduate there, and we spoke
even though I never took a class from him.  I got the chance to get to know him
a little better in the years since – he was kind, thoughtful, generous with his
time, and an emininently sensible senior figure in the numerical linear algebra
community.
 
Howard was an applied mathematician through and through.  He cared a lot about
the mathematics, and about fast implementation of numerics, but he also cared
about the structure that came from applications.  I remember hearing him tell
about an early project that he was involved in where he did a lot of work… and
then found out later that he’d maybe been solving the wrong problem.  It left
an impression, and for the entire time that I knew him – or knew about his
career – I knew him to be assiduously careful about making sure that the things
that he was computing were grounded in some real application that he
understood.  It is one of many things that I admired about him.
 
So: here’s to the mentors who guide us, whether as graduate advisors or as
people we sometimes meet at a conference or workshop.  When you find them, pay
attention.  Sometimes you’ll pick things up in the most off-hand remarks that
stick with you for years.
