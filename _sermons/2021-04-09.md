In April 2014, I visited Nick Trefethen at Oxford, and we went out for a walk together.  I was thinking while walking and talking, and fell into my everyday habit of looking down at the ground as I figured out how to frame what I wanted to say.  And at some point, Nick exclaimed (in some exasperation), that I really should look up!  I don’t remember the exact words he used, but the sentiment was that the sidewalk in Oxford was not so dissimilar from what I’d find anywhere else, but I was missing out if I didn’t look at the buildings.
 
I still remember this seven years later, so clearly it made an impression.
 
Routines and rituals are a fine way to keep organized, to keep moving forward, to keep a sense of regularity to life.  But it is also worth remembering, especially in the middle of a pandemic semester as we mostly try to get by, to look up!  What is making you curious?  What are your dreams and aspirations like right now?  If you look at your to-do list, why are the items there – to keep you fed and healthy, to help someone out, to take care of something that it seems important to take care of, to move toward a long-term goal, to have fun?
