My phone broke this morning, and I am oddly pleased to not have a source
of bad news waiting in my pocket whenever I should happen to look.  Of
course, I need the phone for things like calls and 2FA, and I have indeed
ordered a replacement.  But it is a good reminder that the world goes on
whether I am staring at the news or not.  And on the time scale of one
day, it is probably just as well for us to step away from the news and
focus on what’s in front of us.  It’s certainly true for me.  It likely is
true for you.
