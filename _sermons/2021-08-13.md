Though I hope you are all excited to be back at CAM (or be in CAM for the first
time), we are still entering another uncertain semester.  I remind you again,
as I did a few times last year, that you are your brother’s keeper – keep an
eye out for opportunities not only to do good work, but to do good for each
other, and for the world.  Or, to steal from a conversation on the CS faculty
Slack right now, I hope you can all “follow the PUCK” this semester (PUCK =
Patience, Understanding, Compassion, and Kindness).
