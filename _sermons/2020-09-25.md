No serious charges in the Breona Taylor case, and riots after. DHS seems to be
proposing a regulatory measure to make life hard for international students
again.  The pandemic continue.  And yet: COVID numbers in Ithaca seem under
control.  The weather has been beautiful.  It is a strange world at the moment,
but many of you are making the best of it.

All these things are true.  It is not a normal time, and seems unlikely to
return to anything like normal for a while.  It is OK to be behind, to be
frazzled, to not be on your game.  If you can, though, it is also OK to
appreciate a sunny day.
