We pay attention to milestones and big goals, but we get there day by day.  So
get enough sleep, eat right, try to get out and move around if you can.  Be
patient with your students, your professors, yourselves.  Try to learn
something new every day.  When something goes wrong, roll with it as best you
can, and ask for help if you need it.  You know how to do this.
