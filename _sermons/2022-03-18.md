This is less a sermon than a reminder of a few things that I hope you
already know:
 
You’re at Cornell because we wanted you here.  “We” here includes me,
but I’m going to include the field and the Graduate School in this.
All of us want you to succeed in your time here, and are working to
try to support you (though sometimes subject to constraints that may
not be at all obvious).  And when you do face issues that I might be
able to help with, I’d much rather you tell me about them early than
late – preventive maintenance is almost always the least expensive
option for everyone in time, money, and general grief.
