Spring semester is always a time of beginnings and endings.  For now, we are at
the beginning of a new year; the beginning of a new cycle of life; the
beginning of new classes.  The end of this semester will be a time for several
of you to move on from Cornell, out into the broader world.  I hope it will be
the end of this COVID-centric educational experience, though some elements of
it will doubtless be with us for a while.
 
But in between the beginning and the end, we have 14 intense weeks.  There’s no
spring break this year, and nobody ought to be traveling anyhow.  I hope you
are making plans now for how you are going to sustain yourself through this
semester.  Should you need help with this, check out the [Cornell
Quaranzine](https://www.smore.com/pqj7k-the-cornell-quaranzine).  And I remind
you again – yes, you are your brother’s keeper, and your sister’s.  Check in
with each other.

Good luck with the start of classes.
