Let’s keep the sermon today short and sweet.  The end of the
semester is a transition.  Many of you are planning what comes
next.  For this, a quote from Epictetus comes to mind: “First
say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to
do.”  As you aspire to be scholars, learn and teach.  As you
aspire to be leaders, lead by your example.  And as you aspire
to make the world a better place, find something in your sphere
of influence that you can do to make the world better.  You
don’t get to control much in the world, but you do get to
decide on your own aspirations and actions.  Decide and act
wisely.
