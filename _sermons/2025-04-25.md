In 1963, Clark Kerr (former president of the University of California) gave
the Godkin Lectures at Harvard.  This lecture became the basis of the book
“The Uses of the University,” still considered one of the most significant
pieces of writing on the modern research university in the United States.  I
read this book while a graduate student, and it gave me a lot to think about.
I recommend it to you for reading (or re-reading) in the current moment.
 
One of Kerr’s comments that stuck with me has to do with the longevity of
universities.  The vast majority of institutions in the world that last for
more than a century are financial institutions, religious institutions, or
universities.  Maybe because they are so long-lived, all of these institutions
tend to be small-c conservative: we don’t change quickly except when forced.
But we do change with the times, and we shall do so with these times as well.
For all that is going on right now, I don’t expect Cornell as an institution
to go away.  And we have an institutional commitment to all of you, and that’s
not changing, either.
