I got a wonderful email this afternoon from the teacher of one of my kids about
how the class is “learning the core values of the classroom through discussion,
artwork, reading, sharing, play break, and other activities.”  The values she
listed are:
 
- Above All, Be Kind
- Different Is Good
- Learning Is Not A Race
- It’s Wonderful To Be Wrong
- Be Smart - Ask Questions
- I’m Exactly Who I’m Supposed To Be
- Fair = We All Get What We Need
 
The details change, but I hope the core values you’re embodying in CAM as
umpteenth-graders have a pretty strong overlap with the values being taught in
second grade!
