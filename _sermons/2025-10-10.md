How are you doing?  Fall break is a good time to ask yourself this question, to
take stock, and to adjust as needed.  Are you remembering the basics – getting
enough food, sleep, exercise, social interaction?  Do you have a steady,
sustainable pace of progress for your research and classes, one that’s going to
get you to the end of the semester happy that you’ve hit your milestones
(either set by yourself or set by the university)?  Are you sticking your head
up from time to time in order to think long-term thoughts about where you are
headed and where you want to head?  If you’ve been thinking about the next
problem set, the next meeting with your advisor, the next… whatever, this is a
good time to take a moment to reflect.  And, of course, sometimes it’s good to
simply rest and reset.
 
And on that note: I hope you all have a restful break.  And for those of you
who are traveling, safe travels!
