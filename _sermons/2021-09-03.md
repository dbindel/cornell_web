One day, I hope to start by talking a sermon by talking about how great the
news was!  But the news this week was again full of both natural disasters and
human ones, piled atop the fears and uncertainties brought on by the pandemic.
But these things are largely out of my control.  What I can choose, and do
choose, is to find actions day by day to try to improve the part of the world
around me where I do have some control.
