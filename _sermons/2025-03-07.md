Let’s keep it simple this week.
 
I often remind students in the middle of the semester: remember to eat, sleep,
exercise, and get adequate social contact.  None of this will change what’s
going on in the world around you, but appropriate self-care will help you deal
with the world.
 
This is also a good time to remind you that you are each other’s keepers.  Your
friends and colleagues will need a hand from time to time, and so will you.  We
all do better if we can lift each other up.
