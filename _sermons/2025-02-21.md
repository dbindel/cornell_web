The news continues to be chaotic.  Earlier today, you should have received
email from the president on “Cornell’s guiding principles”; I think it’s worth
reading.

I have little more to add on this front right now, other than to say that we
(CAM and central leadership both) have you in mind, and are spending time
planning for how we’re going to support you in various contingencies.  We’ve
got your back.
 
Otherwise: We’re in mid-semester, and I hope you’ve been finding your rhythm in
your work life.  And while it may not feel like it at this moment, we are
approaching spring: next week is supposed to be warmer, and we’re a little more
than two weeks from the resumption of Daylight Savings Time (starts March 9
this year).  You all are juggling plenty of things, but I hope in addition to
getting research done and succeeding in your classes that you take time to
sleep, enjoy time with friends, and watch the world outside your window.  We
all carry the past with us, and we all think to the future, but we live in the
present, one moment at a time.  Life’s finite.  Make those moments count.
