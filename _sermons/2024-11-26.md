Before we get into this home stretch, I wanted to say three quick things.
 
First, take care of yourselves!  This tends to be a stressful period where a
lot is coming at you.  Plan your work, take it one step at a time, and I expect
you’ll be fine.  The Thanksgiving holiday is a good time to take a breath and a
break.  And if you need a pep talk, just let me know!  I’m away for the next
few days, but I’m back and around again on Monday, and my tea kettle and "This
is Literally Just a Book of Cute Animals to Make You Feel Better" will be there
in Rhodes 612.
 
Second, take care of each other.  This has always been a busy time of year, and
there are maybe some extra stressors this year.  We all prop each other up
regularly; just watch for folks who might need some extra propping!
 
Finally, I wanted to say how grateful I am to all of you for being who you are.
Since coming back and settling into Rhodes 612, I have enjoyed saying hello
when you pass my door, and I’ve enjoyed chances to come in and sit on the
purple couches and share your company.  I am thankful beyond measure to be in a
place where we have a supportive community in each other, and I do not take it
for granted.
 
Happy Thanksgiving, all!
