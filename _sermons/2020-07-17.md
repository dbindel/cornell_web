When I was an undergraduate, I was part of the honors program at the University
of Maryland.  At the time, the director was Maynard (“Sandy”) Mack of the
English department.  He sent out an email about once a week, and always said
the same thing at the start of the semester — and often in the middle of it:

> I'll always repeat at the start of each semester: in many ways we are our
> brother's/sister's keepers. If someone seems troubled, reach out. The worst
> you can get is yelled at, and you just might save someone's semester...or
> life. Be kindly nosey, please. This perilous uncharted journey called life
> can be terrifically exciting in its freedom, and it can be overwhelming, in
> its freedom, too. Take care.

Yes, I still have those “sermon” emails, now from more than twenty years ago.
 And I still think about them at times like this.  So obviously the message
stuck with me, and I still find it helpful.  I hope the same thought is also
helpful to you in these T-6 weeks until the fall.
