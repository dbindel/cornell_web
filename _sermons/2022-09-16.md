The Canadian writer Laurence Peters said "Early to bed, early to rise, work
like hell, and advertise."  I don’t know what all your sleep routines are,
though I hope you’ve figured out for yourself how to get plenty of sleep each
night.  You all know that graduate school is hard work, though maybe hard in
different ways from your undergraduate work, and none of you are lazy (if you
think you are, [consider slowing down and focusing on your values](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/13/1070793482/laziness-tips)).  But most
of us could stand to be better at advertising.

What is advertising for a researcher?  It’s not about marching into spaces
yelling "I am so smart!"; it’s about sharing why you’re excited about your
work.  That can mean communicating with peers through talks and papers; showing
up and asking good questions in other peoples’ talks; talking to a broader
audience in a variety of ways; showing up and asking good questions; or even
just making sure you have an up-to-date professional web site with a
description of your research and links to talks and papers (we can do this on
the CAM space, but Github pages and Netlify are also good hosting resources).

You all do cool stuff.  Don’t hide your light under a basket.
