There are some scam messages out there with my name attached to them.
Some signs are:

- If the message is not from my Cornell email address and it claims that
  I need to talk to you about something in my Cornell capacity, it is a scam.
- I will never ask you to deal with gift cards.
- Cornell has processes for student hiring, and they do *not* involve texting
  your personal information to random phone numbers.  That is a scam.

The Cornell [Phish Bowl](https://it.cornell.edu/phish-bowl) has many other
examples of scam messages that have been reported, as well as advice on how to
spot them.  If you think I may actually have reached out to you and aren't
sure, feel free to mail my official email and ask "is this a scam?"
