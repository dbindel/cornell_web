 Let $T : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ be a matrix-valued
function that is analytic on some simply-connected domain $\Omega
\subset \mathbb{C}$.  We call a point $\lambda \in \Omega$ an eigenvalue if
the matrix $T(\lambda)$ is singular.  Nonlinear eigenvalue problems
arise in many applications, often from applying transform methods to
analyze differential and difference equations.  We describe new
localization results for nonlinear eigenvalues that generalize
Gershgorin's theorem, pseudospectral inclusion theorems, the
Bauer-Fike theorem, and others.
