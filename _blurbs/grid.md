The power grid is changing, driven by many factors: the push to
increased renewable energy sources, highly dynamic power markets, and
deployment high-resolution measurements of transmission networks by
syncrophasor measurement units (PMUs).  How can computer science help
operators make well-informed decisions in this increasingly dynamic
and data-rich environment?  As part of a larger effort at Cornell
focused on putting the smarts into smart grids, we are looking into
ways to mine the data from PMUs and related sensors in order to
quickly determine when and where power lines are failing -- before an
irate customer calls to complain about an outage.
