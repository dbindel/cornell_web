In this collection of research projects, we take a layered approach to
foundational verification of correctness and accuracy of numerical
softwareâ€“that is, formal machine-checked proofs about programs (not
just algorithms), with no assumptions except specifications of
instruction-set architectures. We build, improve, and use appropriate
tools at each layer: proving in the real numbers about discrete
algorithms; proving how floating-point algorithms approximate
real-number algorithms; reasoning about C program implementation of
floating-point algorithms; and connecting all proofs end-to-end in
Coq.
