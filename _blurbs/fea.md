Finite element analysis is a method for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs).  There are many other methods for solving PDEs with
different features, but finite element methods are attractive both
because they work well with complex geometries and because they are
relatively simple to implement and analyze.  I use [existing codes][feap]
where appropriate, but have released several
finite element [software packages][sw] for simulating problems from
[MEMS design][mems] and [analysis of human bone][bone].
