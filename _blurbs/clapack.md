CLAPACK was developed in the early 1990s alongside LAPACK.
I was responsible for producing version 3.0 of the library,
and supported the library for several years.  CLAPACK has
largely been superceded by [LAPACKE], though the package
continues to be used on systems where a FORTRAN compiler is
unavailable.
