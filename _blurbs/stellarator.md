*Stellarators* are non-axisymmetric magnetic field configurations for
confinement of fusion plasmas.  In contrast to the more popular
axisymmetric *tokamak* geometries, stellarators rely on symmetry
breaking to confine particles.  We are pleased to be part of the the
Simons Collaboration on Hidden Symmetries and Fusion Energy, a team
dedicated to advancing the mathematical and computational state of the
art in stellarator design and producing a modern stellarator
optimization code that can exploit the full power of petascale and
exascale computers.  With expertise spanning optimization theory,
plasma physics, dynamical systems, and PDE analysis.  Our
collaboration model is based on shared postdocs -- if this sounds like
it might be exciting to you, we are looking!
