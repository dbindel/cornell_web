  Seeking solid-wave solitons in resonant MEMS
---

Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are micron-scale machines used in
everything from accelerometers to digital projectors.  In particular,
mechanically resonating MEMS are critical to many everyday gadgets; but usually
we prefer to design devices with /linear/ vibrations.  Physicists working in
optics have illustrated a wide variety of interesting effects involving
/nonlinear/ wave mechanics, including generation of optical solitons and
frequency combs.  The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility
of similar nonlinear mechanical wave effects in micro-resonators.
