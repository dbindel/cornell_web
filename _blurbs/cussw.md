The purpose of the Cornell Scientific Software Club is to learn about
modern tools relevant for developing and deploying scientific codes.
Researchers from all areas of computational science and engineering are
welcome. The club meets Mondays at 6 pm in Gates 122.

If you are interested in participating, please sign up!  Official enrollment
is useful for helping us figure out resources (e.g. pizza and computing cycles),
but we also welcome anyone who wants to just receive our emails.
