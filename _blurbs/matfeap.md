MATFEAP is a MATLAB interface to the academic finite element
code [FEAP].  A successor to the earlier FEAPMEX interface,
it uses a socket connection to communicate via a lightweight
protocol with a FEAP server interface.

Starting in Fall 2016, I am advertising a [project](/meng.html) to build a
Jupyter notebook interface to the personal version of FEAP (FEAPpv)
to make it easy to use FEAP as an instructional tool by launching
cloud instances.  If you are interested reading this, let me know!
