SUGAR is a simulation package for MEMS whose name and heritage come from
the SPICE family of circuit simulators.  Like SPICE, SUGAR is a
system-level simulation tool to allow designers to quickly test designs
and run "what-if" experiments without the cost of a detailed simulation
of device physics. SUGAR was originally developed by Jason Clark and
Ningning Zhou at UC Berkeley in the late 1990s; I rewrote the system
when I joined the project in the early 2000s.  SUGAR is still available
(and used!), though no longer maintained.  Jason Clark developed a
successor to SUGAR, the commercial [SugarCube] package; our work also
inspired several other commercial tools.
