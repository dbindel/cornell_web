[SUGAR](http://mems.sourceforge.net) is a simulation package for MEMS
whose name and heritage come from the SPICE family of circuit
simulators.  Like SPICE, SUGAR is a system-level simulation tool to
allow designers to quickly test designs and run "what-if" experiments
without the cost of a detailed simulation of device physics.  Though
SUGAR is no longer being actively developed, one of our long-term
goals is to add system-level modeling to HiQLab, so that we have a
platform for integrating detailed device-level simulations into
broader system-level simulations.
