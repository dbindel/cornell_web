Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are micron-scale machines used
in everything from accelerometers to digital projectors.  Resonating
MEMS are critical to many everyday gadgets -- without MEMS
resonators, your iPhone would not know when to switch from landscape
to portrait mode!  I work on simulation tools to help engineers design
these types of devices.

For many applications of resonant MEMS, it is important to minimize
damping, but it is often unclear which mechanisms most strongly affect
damping.   HiQLab is a finite element code for analyzing  high-frequency
resonant MEMS, with specialized models and solvers for dealing with loss
mechanisms such as thermoelastic damping (TED) and anchor loss. I
developed it as part of my PhD thesis work at Berkeley. With HiQLab, we
provide designers with tools to understand damping in resonant devices,
and to understand how changes to the design (or accidental changes due
to processing variation) affect the device behavior.
