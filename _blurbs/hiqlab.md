  Tools for simulating damping mechanisms in resonant microsystems.
---

Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are micron-scale machines used
in everything from accelerometers to digital projectors.  Resonating
MEMS are critical to many everyday gadgets -- without MEMS
resonators, your iPhone would not know when to switch from landscape
to portrait mode!  I work on simulation tools to help engineers design
these types of devices.

For many applications of resonant MEMS, it is important to minimize
damping, but it is often unclear which mechanisms most strongly affect
damping.  Our work on resonant MEMS simulation has focused on
providing designers with tools to understand damping in resonant
devices, and to understand how changes to the design (or accidental
changes due to processing variation) affect the device behavior.
