MatScat is a code to compute scattering solutions and resonances
for a Schrodinger equation with a compactly supported piecewise
smooth potential.  The results are validated by error estimates
based on a backward error analysis.  [MatScat] is the
basis for [MatScatPy], a Python translation written by Sheroze
Sherifdeen and Chaitali Joshi in a project in Fall 2015.
