The definition of "data science" is nebulous, with experts from
various scientific fields claiming the name for almost anything
involving statistics, machine learning, scalable algorithms for mining
large data sets, or new sources of large-scale data such as modern
telescopes or DNA sequencers.  But almost any definition is grounded
in numerical computing; and work in data science, broadly construed,
is driving research in numerical methods design in new and interesting
directions.  These courses, and a book-in-progress, reflect how my
thinking about numerical methods has evolved over the past decade from
working on a variety of data science and machine learning problems.
Starting from a foundation of numerical linear algebra, statistical
computing, optimization, and function approximation, we proceed to
explore applications of these ideas near the research frontiers in
network analysis, topic modeling, large-scale regression, and modeling
of dynamics from data.
