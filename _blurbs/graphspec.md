Linear algebra is a common theme in graph analysis, and spectral
approaches to graph partitioning, clustering, and ranking are among
the most popular methods now available.  We use spectral ideas
to explore graphs in novel ways, whether looking at local clusters
and communities in graph or looking at how the global PageRank vector
changes with systematic variations in how a graph is constructed.
Often, these forays into spectral graph theory start from a
completely different problem; recent examples include analyzing
models of opinion formation and understanding the difficulty of
a standard problem from computer vision (rotation averaging).
