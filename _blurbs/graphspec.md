Linear algebra is a common theme in graph analysis, and spectral
approaches to graph partitioning, clustering, and ranking are among
the most popular methods now available.  We use spectral ideas
to explore graphs in novel ways, whether looking at local clusters
and communities in graph or looking at how the global PageRank vector
changes with systematic variations in how a graph is constructed.
