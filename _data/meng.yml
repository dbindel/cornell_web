  title: CMS Experiment
  tags: [physics, web]
  blurb: |
    The [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)][cms] experiment is a large particle
    physics detector built on the Large Hadron Collidor at CERN.  At this
    point, so many users are working on this experiment that there is a
    strong need not only to mine experimental data, but also to mine data
    about users and user activity.  CS MEng students may be interested
    in [some data mining projects out of Cornell physics][cmswiki] related
    to these projects.  If so, please contact Valentin Kuznetsov or Peter
    Wittich for further details -- but you can likely talk me into being
    your CS field representative.

  title: Notebook Widgets for Simulation Steering and Monitoring
  tags: [tools, web]
  blurb: |
    Python has a long history as a system for steering large-scale
    physical simulations, and remains useful for this purpose today.
    In contrast, IPython notebooks are proving increasingly useful for
    managing and documenting small-scale simulations and data analysis
    tasks.  I would like to have the best of both worlds by using an
    IPython notebook as the control panel for some of my simulation
    and optimization codes, sending control messages from a client
    notebook and receiving updates that can be accessed either from
    the Python environment or from an interactive visualization
    widget.  Many of the pieces for this project are already there
    (e.g. in the IPython parallel module and the IPython interactive
    widget architecture), but they don't quite do what I would like.

    To work on this project, it would probably be helpful to have
    some exposure to Python and Javascript.

  title: Super Seminar Scraper
  tags: [tools, web]
  blurb: |
    Every major university runs seminars and colloquia, and the data
    about speakers, titles, and abstracts is often posted online.  The
    topics and speakers often say a great deal both about the venue
    and about what's hot in the field in general; but while the
    information is available "in the wild", it is not in a form that
    is amenable to machine parsing.  Help me make a serious stab at
    putting together a scraper capable of gathering this information
    in a coherent form -- and if there's time left, help me run some
    clustering and topic mining to figure out what trendy topics people
    are talking about in your favorite corner of computer science.

  title: Who Matters for What?  Learning to Rank with Edge Data
  tags: [networks]
  blurb: |
    In a recent paper, we developed fast methods to compute PageRank
    for graphs with edge weights that are parametric functions of
    edge attributes.  The method is fast, but I was never happy with
    our examples!  Come help me build a public network dataset with
    meaningful edge attributes and a compelling demo to show why looking
    at more than one attribute at a time can matter.
-
  title: PageRank with Uncertain Edge Weights
  tags: [networks]
  blurb: |
    Consider a graph with known topology but with random edge weights
    (possibly with known mean values plus some noise uncertainty).  Under
    what conditions can we efficiently characterize the distribution of
    the PageRank vector in such a graph?  I have some methods that may
    help make this efficient, but would love help working out the details.
    
    To work on this course, you should have a good grounding in
    probability and at least the standard linear algebra course.

  title: Optimizing social networks
  tags: [networks]
  blurb: |    
    In a [recent paper](paper/focs11-opinions-full.pdf), Jon
    Kleinberg, Sigal Oren, and I studied social cost in a simple model
    of opinion formation in a social network.  As part of this
    research, we asked some about the "best" edges to add to a social
    network in order to minimize the social cost of the equilibrium
    opinion.  Our results mostly established that variants of this
    problem are NP-hard, but I am curious about how well continuous
    optimization methods do on these problems in practice.

    To work on this project, you should have undergrad courses in
    linear algebra and scientific computing, and you should be
    familiar with MATLAB.

  title: Network Classification via Spectral Features
  tags: [networks, eigen]
  blurbs: |
    What distinguishes a citation network from a road network from a
    social network?  There are many potentially distinguishing
    features, such as degree distributions and triangle counts, but
    recently I have become interested in features based on eigenvalue
    distributions that are very different for artificial model graphs
    and "real-world" networks.  Help me use these features to cluster
    some real-world networks, and to compare that clustering to
    clustering based on more standard features (and to ground-truth
    clustering where available).

    To work on this project, you should have an undergrad course in
    linear algebra.  A course in scientific computing or machine
    learning might also help, but is probably not strictly necessary.

  title: Etch-a-sketch 3D
  tags: [physics, web]
  blurb: |    
    Learn to build 3D visualizations using
    [XTK](https://github.com/xtk/X#readme),
    built on HTML5, SVG, and WebGL, and help me attach those simulations
    to an existing simulator for etch-based MEMS fabrication!  Depending
    on your interests, this project could focus on:

     - Designing a user interface to couple the visualization to an online
       mask editing environment
     - Integration with [iPython notebooks][ipy]
     - The simulation engine, which is based on fast marching methods
       (used in graphics and vision applications as well as in scientific
       computing)
     - More sophisticated etch simulation methods that include
       diffusion-limited etch scenarios

  title: Language technology for matrix computations
  tags: [tools]
  blurb: |
    I have worked on several little tools for optimizing the evaluation of
    matrix expressions using a simple MATLAB-like language.  These include
    a source-to-source translator called
    [Matexpr](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/cims/matexpr/) that
    compiles C/C++ programs augmented with simple fixed-size expressions
    into ordinary C++, and a system embedded in one of my finite element
    code that applies common transformations appropriate for sparse
    matrices and identifies common subexpressions that can be memoized.
    I would like to combine these tools and extend them with annotations
    of structural features that can be used for optimized code generation.

    To work on this project, you should have some knowledge of compilers
    and of matrix computations.

  title: Automating floating point error analysis
  tags: [tools]
  blurb: |
    Floating point error analysis of simple expressions is a standard
    topic in introductory scientific computing courses.
    Unfortunately, such analyses can be tedious and error prone.
    Fortunately, we know how to automate some of this tedium -- at
    least in principle.  I would like to make a package for symbolic
    rounding error analysis, along with a set of demonstrations
    suitable for a first course in scientific computing.
    
    To work on this project, you should have at least an introductory
    course in numerical analysis.

  title: Fast DNN+LR Projections
  tags: [eigen]
  blurbs: |
    For a topic mining application (joint work with David Mimno),
    I am looking for a way to quickly project sparse matrices to the
    closest (low rank) doubly non-negative matrix -- that is, a matrix
    that is both positive definite and elementwise non-negative.
    The catch is that the algorithm should ideally never form a full
    dense representation.  I have some ideas about how to do this,
    though they are not completely fleshed out.

    For this project, you should probably have a good linear algebra
    class and prior exposure to gradient-based optimization methods.
    And you'll need to remember your multivariate calculus.

  title: Preconditioning Radial Basis Functions with Clustered Centers
  tags: [rbf]
  blurb: |
    Radial basis function interpolation is a standard method of
    interpolating data in more than one space dimension.  It has many
    attractive features, but the problem can become unstable when posed
    in the normal basis, particularly for very smooth basis functions
    or when the basis function centers are clustered.  Recently-developed
    methods address the former case, but the latter is more of a concern
    when RBF interpolants are used for optimization, as is the case in
    some of my projects.  I have an idea for a formally equivalent method
    that gets around this stability issue by a preconditioning strategy,
    and would like help implementing it.

    You should have a course in numerical computing and some
    mathematical maturirity to take on this project.

  title: Model Reduction of Buckling Lattices
  tags: [physics]
  blurb: |
    Three-dimensional printing lets us make elaborately
    microstructured materials, but our understanding of how to model
    these microstructures is still young.  The mechanics of microtruss
    structures can be analyzed by mostly-standard methods when the
    strains are small and the truss structure is periodic; but the
    picture becomes more complex even at small strains when the truss
    is not quite periodic, and it becomes very complicated at large
    strains when the individual elements can buckle.  I have some ideas
    about how to use a type of model reduction to simulate the behavior
    of such structures quickly, and would like to try them out -- but
    given the background required, and given that I don't have a code
    to do it at hand, I would be delighted to have some help first putting
    together a code to do the analysis in the simple case.

    You should have a course in numerical computing to tackle this
    project.  Prior exposure to finite element analysis or structural
    analysis will also be helpful.

  title: Response Surfaces for Structure Prediction
  tags: [physics, rbf]
  blurb: |
    [GASP](https://github.com/henniggroup/gasp) is a Genetic Algorithm
    for Structure and Phase Prediction that "predicts the structure
    and composition of stable and metastable phases of crystals,
    molecules, atomic clusters and defects from first-principles."  An
    alternative to using genetic algorithms to understand the energy
    landscape is to use surrogate methods (aka response surface
    methods), but initial experiences suggest that this won't work
    well unless the response surface is carefully chosen.  I'd like to
    try a response surface approach that incorporates some basic
    chemical knowledge (e.g. the knowledge that potential energy blows
    up if you try to put two atoms en the same place) in order to get
    a better result.

    This probably isn't a very good project for most CS MEng students,
    but if you're coming from a background where building an optimizer
    on top of a DFT code sounds fun, come talk to me!
