  text: |
    PySOT is a toolbox of surrogate function methods for global
    optimization in spaces of moderately high dimension (tens
    of parameters).  Both continuous and integer variables are
    allowed.  This code is under active development by David
    Eriksson and myself.

  text: |
    POAP is an infrastructure package to support optimization
    methods for expensive function interfaces.  Function evaluations
    are carried out by workers (which may be local threads or remote
    processes) at the behest of a controller, with communication by
    TCP, MPI, or local message queues.  The controller exposes these
    resources to strategies, which can be composed in various ways;
    for example, composing a standard optimization strategy with a
    retry strategy can make the optimizer robust to worker failures.
    POAP is the underlying substrate for PySOT.

  name: RSC
  short: Rank-structured Cholesky for fast PDE solves

      url: https://github.com/jeffchadwick/rank_structured_cholesky
  text: |
    The Rank Structured Cholesky (RSC) solver was developed by
    Jeff Chadwick (Ph.D. 2013) in joint work with me;
    it is based on Tim Davis's [CHOLMOD][suite], a widely-used
    standard sparse Cholesky solver.
    Unlike CHOLMOD, the RSC solver
    takes advantage of low-rank block structure that appears naturally
    in many large linear systems that arise in elliptic PDE
    discretizations, and so has good scaling properties in both
    time and memory complexity.  Unlike some other solvers based on
    similar ideas, the RSC solver also has good performance in
    practice, as it is engineered from the ground up to make
    good use of fast level-3 BLAS routines.

  text: |
    MatScat is a code to compute scattering solutions and resonances
    for a Schrodinger equation with a compactly supported piecewise
    smooth potential.  The results are validated by error estimates
    based on a backward error analysis.  [MatScat] is the
    basis for [MatScatPy], a Python translation written by Sheroze
    Sherifdeen and Chaitali Joshi in a project in Fall 2015.

  text: |
    MWrap is a little language for mixing MATLAB and C in a natural way,
    much as Cython allows one to mix Python and C.

      url: https://github.com/dbindel/matfeap
  text: |
    MATFEAP is a MATLAB interface to the academic finite element
    code [FEAP].  A successor to the earlier FEAPMEX interface,
    it uses a socket connection to communicate via a lightweight
    protocol with a FEAP server interface.

  text: |
    matexpr is a source-to-source translator for embedding simple
    MATLAB-like matrix expressions in C/C++. matexpr interprets special
    comments in a source file and uses them to generate ordinary C code.

      url: https://bitbucket.org/dbindel/hiqlab/
  text: |
    HiQLab is a finite element code for analyzing  high-frequency
    resonant MEMS, with specialized models and solvers for dealing with
    loss mechanisms such as thermoelastic damping (TED) and anchor loss.
    I developed it as part of my PhD thesis work at Berkeley.

  text: |
    SUGAR is a system-level simulation tool for MEMS inspired by
    the SPICE circuit simulation system.  SUGAR was originally
    developed by Jason Clark and Ningning Zhou at UC Berkeley in
    the late 1990s; I rewrote the system when I joined the project
    in the early 2000s.  SUGAR is still available (and used!),
    though no longer maintained.  Jason Clark developed a successor
    to SUGAR, the commercial [SugarCube] package; our
    work also inspired several other commercial tools.

  text: |
    CLAPACK was developed in the early 1990s alongside LAPACK.
    I was responsible for producing version 3.0 of the library,
    and supported the library for several years.  CLAPACK has
    largely been superceded by [LAPACKE], though the package
    continues to be used on systems where a FORTRAN compiler is
    unavailable.
