  snippet: |
    Fundamentals of numerical linear algebra (linear systems,
    eigenvalues and SVDs), on which we'll build iterative methods
    for nonlinear systems and multivariate optimization.
    Understanding advantages, disadvantages, and practical limits of
    numerical methods.  Programming required.

  snippet: |
    Overview of high performance scientific computing.  Basics of
    modern parallel machine design, parallel programming patterns,
    and applications.  Programming projects will likely inspire
    creative cursing, mostly due to the frustrations of parallel
    profiling and debugging.

  snippet: |
    Numerical linear algebra.  Basic theory, efficient
    algorithms, and enough error analysis to avoid numerical
    embarrassment (we hope)!  Direct and iterative methods for
    linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalues.
