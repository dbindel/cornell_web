  snippet:
      Overview of high performance scientific computing.  Basics of
      modern parallel machine design, parallel programming patterns,
      and applications.  Programming projects will likely inspire
      creative cursing, mostly due to the frustrations of parallel
      profiling and debugging.

  snippet:
      Numerical linear algebra.  Basic theory, efficient
      algorithms, and enough error analysis to avoid numerical
      embarrassment (we hope)!  Direct and iterative methods for
      linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalues.
