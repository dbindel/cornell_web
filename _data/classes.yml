# Cornell courses

sjtu-nmds:
  class: SJTU CS 259
  title: Numerical Methods for Data Science
  image: data-dots.jpg
  snippet: |
    Survey course of numerical methods prominent in modern
    data analysis and machine learning.  Building on basic methods
    of optimization and numerical linear algebra, the course will
    explore the role of numerical methods for treating several
    classes of data analysis problems, including low rank
    factorizations and completion of matrix data; function
    approximation by kernel methods; and analysis of data on graphs.

cs6241:
  class: CS 6241
  title: Numerical Methods for Data Science
  image: data-dots.jpg
  snippet: |
    Discussion of numerical methods in the context of machine learning
    and data analysis problems.  We will discuss sparsity, rank
    structure, and spectral behavior of underlying linear algebra
    problems; convergence behavior and implicit regularization for
    standard solvers; and comparisons between numerical methods in
    data analysis and those used in physical simulations.

cs4220:
  class: CS 4220/5223 / MATH 4260
  title: "Numerical Analysis: Linear and Nonlinear Problems"
  image: cs07medium.jpg
  snippet: |
    Fundamentals of numerical linear algebra (linear systems,
    eigenvalues and SVDs), on which we'll build iterative methods
    for nonlinear systems and multivariate optimization.
    Understanding advantages, disadvantages, and practical limits of
    numerical methods.  Programming required.

cs5220:
  class: CS 5220
  title: Applications of Parallel Computers
  image: bluegene.jpg
  snippet: |
    Overview of high performance scientific computing.  Basics of
    modern parallel machine design, parallel programming patterns,
    and applications.  Programming projects will likely inspire
    creative cursing, mostly due to the frustrations of parallel
    profiling and debugging.

cs6210:
  class: CS 6210
  title: Matrix Computations
  image: GVL4.png
  snippet: |
    Numerical linear algebra.  Basic theory, efficient
    algorithms, and enough error analysis to avoid numerical
    embarrassment (we hope)!  Direct and iterative methods for
    linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalues.

cs3220:
  class: CS 3220
  title: Introduction to Scientific Computing
  image: cs07medium.jpg
  snippet: |
    No longer offered; see [CS 4210][cs4210] and [CS 4220][cs4220].

    Overview of scientific computing in MATLAB, from a user
    perspective.  Error analysis basics, linear systems and least
    squares, nonlinear equations, basic optimization, numerical
    differentiation and quadrature, ODEs, and applications.

  snippet: |
    The Scientific Computing and Numerics seminar series
    focuses on various methods in scientific computing,
    the analysis of convergence properties and computational efficiency,
    and their adaptation to specific applications.
