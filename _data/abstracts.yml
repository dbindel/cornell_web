    Rotations averaging has become a key subproblem in global Structure
    from Motion methods. Several solvers exist, but they do not have
    guarantees of correctness. They can produce high-quality results,
    but also sometimes fail. Our understanding of what makes rotations
    averaging problems easy or hard is still very limited. To
    investigate the difficulty of rotations averaging, we perform a
    local convexity analysis under an $L_2$ cost function. Although a
    previous result has shown that in general, this problem is locally
    convex almost nowhere, we show how this negative conclusion can be
    reversed by considering the gauge ambiguity.

    Our theoretical analysis reveals the factors that determine local
    convexity---noise and graph structure---as well as how they
    interact, which we describe by a particular Laplacian matrix. Our
    results are useful for predicting the difficulty of problems, and we
    demonstrate this on practical datasets. Our work forms the basis of
    a deeper understanding of the key properties of rotations averaging
    problems, and we discuss how it can inform the design of future
    solvers for this important problem.

    We address a semi-supervised learning problem of identifying all
    latent members of a local community from very few labeled seed members
    in large networks. By a simple and efficient sampling method, we
    conduct a comparatively small subgraph encompassing most of the latent
    members such that the follow-up membership identification could focus
    on an accurate local region instead of the whole network. Then we look
    for a sparse vector, a relaxed indicator vector representing the
    subordinative probability of the corresponding nodes, that lies in a
    local spectral subspace defined by an order-$d$ Krylov subspace. The
    subspace serves as a local proxy for the invariant subspace spanned by
    leading eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices. Based on Rayleigh
    quotients, we relate the local membership identification task as a
    local RatioCut or local normalized cut optimization problem, and
    provide some theoretical justifications.

    We thoroughly explore different probability diffusion methods for the
    subspace definition and evaluate our method on four groups with a
    total of 28 representative LFR benchmark datasets, and eight public
    available real-world networks with labeled ground truth communities
    across multiple domains. Experimental results exhibit the
    effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm, and the
    local spectral communities perform better than those from the
    celebrated Heat Kernel diffusion and the PageRank diffusion.

    In this paper, we present a Fingerprint Linear Estimation Routine
    (FLiER) to identify topology changes in power networks using
    readings from sparsely-deployed phasor measurement units (PMUs).
    When a power line, load, or generator trips in a network, or when a
    substation is reconfigured, the event leaves a unique "voltage
    fingerprint" of bus voltage changes that we can identify using only
    the portion of the network directly observed by the PMUs. The naive
    brute-force approach to identify a failed line from such voltage
    fingerprints, though simple and accurate, is slow. We derive an
    approximate algorithm based on a local linearization and a novel
    filtering approach that is faster and only slightly less accurate.
    We present experimental results using the IEEE 57-bus, IEEE 118-bus,
    and Polish 1999-2000 winter peak networks.

    We analyze the change of angular gain and vibration frequency of
    solid-state wave gyroscopes as a result of geometry perturbations due
    to thermal expansion. We analyze sensitivity of the device to thermal
    expansion effects by an isoparametric finite element analysis method,
    and we analyze the sensitivity to thermal changes in the material
    properties assuming a linear dependence on temperature.  We quantify
    these sensitivities for common device geometries, and use our analysis
    as the basis for a local optimization problem that minimizes
    temperature sensitivity as a function of device shape.

    Let $T : \Omega \rightarrow {\Bbb C}^{n\times n}$ be a matrix-valued
    function that is analytic on some simply-connected domain $\Omega
    \subset {\Bbb C}$.  A point $\lambda \in \Omega$ is an eigenvalue if
    the matrix $T(\lambda)$ is singular.  In this paper, we describe new
    localization results for nonlinear eigenvalue problems that generalize
    Gershgorin's theorem, pseudospectral inclusion theorems, and the
    Bauer-Fike theorem.  We use our results to analyze three nonlinear
    eigenvalue problems: an example from delay differential equations, a
    problem due to Hadeler, and a quantum resonance computation.

    Configuring large distributed computations is a challenging task.
    Efficiently executing distributed computations requires configuration
    tuning based on careful examination of application and hardware
    properties. Considering the large number of parameters and
    impracticality of using trial and error in a production environment,
    programmers tend to make these decisions based on their experience and
    rules of thumb. Such configurations can lead to underutilized and
    costly clusters, and missed deadlines.

    In this paper, we present a new methodology for determining desired
    hardware and software configuration parameters for distributed
    computations. The key insight behind this methodology is to build a
    response surface that captures how applications perform under
    different hardware and software configuration. Such a model can be
    built through iterated experiments using the real system, or, more
    efficiently, using a simulator. The resulting model can then generate
    recommendations for configuration parameters that are likely to yield
    the desired results even if they have not been tried either in
    simulation or in real-life. The process can be iterated to refine
    previous predictions and achieve better results.

    We have implemented this methodology in a configuration recommendation
    system for MapReduce 2.0 applications. Performance measurements show
    that representative applications achieve up to $5 \times$ performance
    improvement when they use the recommended configuration parameters
    compared to the default ones.

    Spectral inference provides fast algorithms and provable optimality
    for latent topic analysis. But for real data these algorithms require
    additional ad-hoc heuristics, and even then often produce unusable
    results. We explain this poor performance by casting the problem of
    topic inference in the framework of Joint Stochastic Matrix
    Factorization (JSMF) and showing that previous methods violate the
    theoretical conditions necessary for a good solution to exist. We then
    propose a novel rectification method that learns high quality topics
    and their interactions even on small, noisy data. This method achieves
    results comparable to probabilistic techniques in several domains
    while maintaining scalability and provable optimality.

    Based on the definition of local spectral subspace, we propose a novel
    approach called LOSP for local overlapping community detection. Using
    the power method for a few steps, LOSP finds an approximate invariant
    subspace, which depicts the embedding of the local neighborhood
    structure around the seeds of interest. LOSP then identifies the local
    community expanded from the given seeds by seeking a sparse indicator
    vector in the subspace where the seeds are in its support. We provide
    a systematic investigation on LOSP, and thoroughly evaluate it on
    large real world networks across multiple domains. With the prior
    information of very few seed members, LOSP can detect the remaining
    members of a target community with high accuracy. Experiments
    demonstrate that LOSP outperforms the Heat Kernel and PageRank
    diffusions. Using LOSP as a subroutine, we further address the problem
    of multiple membership identification, which aims to find all the
    communities a single vertex belongs to. High F1 scores are achieved in
    detecting multiple local communities with respect to arbitrary single
    seed for various large real world networks.

    Personalized PageRank is a standard tool for finding vertices in a
    graph that are most relevant to a query or user. To personalize
    PageRank, one adjusts node weights or edge weights that determine
    teleport probabilities and transition probabilities in a random surfer
    model. There are many fast methods to approximate PageRank when the
    node weights are personalized; however, personalization based on edge
    weights has been an open problem since the dawn of personalized
    PageRank over a decade ago. In this paper, we describe the first fast
    algorithm for computing PageRank on general graphs when the edge
    weights are personalized. Our method, which is based on model
    reduction, outperforms existing methods by nearly *five orders of
    magnitude*. This huge performance gain over previous work allows us —
    for the very first time — to solve learning-to-rank problems for edge
    weight personalization *at interactive speeds*, a goal that had not
    previously been achievable for this class of problems.

    The kernel polynomial method (KPM) is a standard tool in condensed
    matter physics to estimate the density of states for a quantum system.
    We use the KPM to instead estimate the eigenvalue densities of the
    normalized adjacency matrices of "natural" graphs. Because natural
    graph spectra often include high-multiplicity eigenvalues
    corresponding to certain motifs in the graph, we introduce a
    pre-processing phase that counts just these special eigenvalues,
    leaving the rest of the eigenvalue distribution to be estimated by the
    standard KPM.

    The question of how people form their opinion has fascinated
    economists and sociologists for long time. In many of the models, a
    group of people in a social network, each holding a numerical opinion,
    arrive at a shared opinion through repeated averaging with their
    neighbors in the network. Motivated by the observation that in reality
    consensus is rarely reached, we study a related sociological model in
    which individuals' intrinsic beliefs counterbalance the averaging
    process and yield a diversity of opinions.

    We interpret the repeated averaging process as best-response dynamics
    in an underlying game with natural payoffs and its limit as an
    equilibrium. This allows us to study the cost of disagreement by
    comparing between the cost at equilibrium and the social optimum. We
    also consider a natural network design problem in this setting: which
    links can we add to the underlying network to reduce the cost at
    equilibrium?

    Direct factorization methods for the solution of large, sparse
    linear systems that arise from PDE discretizations are robust, but
    typically show poor time and memory scalability for large systems.
    In this paper, we describe an efficient sparse, rank-structured
    Cholesky algorithm for solution of the positive definite linear
    system Ax=b when A comes from a discretized partial-differential
    equation. Our approach combines the efficient memory access patterns
    of conventional supernodal Cholesky algorithms with the memory
    efficiency of rank-structured direct solvers. For several test
    problems arising from PDE discretizations, our method takes less
    memory than standard sparse Cholesky solvers and less wall-clock
    time than standard preconditioned iterations.

    Large graphs arise in a number of contexts and understanding their
    structure and extracting information from them is an important
    research area. Early algorithms on mining communities have focused
    on the global structure, and often run in time functional to the
    size of the entire graph. Nowadays, as we often explore networks
    with billions of vertices and find communities of size hundreds, it
    is crucial to shift our attention from macroscopic structure to
    microscopic structure when dealing with large networks. A growing
    body of work has been adopting local expansion methods in order to
    identify the community from a few exemplary seed members. Very few
    approaches can systematically demonstrate both high efficiency and
    effectiveness that significantly stands out amongst the divergent
    approaches in finding communities.

    In this paper, we propose a novel approach for finding overlapping
    communities called LEMON (Local Expansion via Minimum One Norm).
    Different from PageRank-like diffusion methods, LEMON finds the
    community by seeking a sparse vector in the span of the local
    spectra such that the seeds are in its support. We show that LEMON
    can achieve the highest detection accuracy among state-of-the-art
    proposals. The running time depends on the size of the community
    rather than that of the entire graph. The algorithm is easy to
    implement, and is highly parallelizable.

    Moreover, given that networks are not all similar in nature, a
    comprehensive analysis on how the local expansion approach is suited
    for uncovering communities in different networks is still lacking.
    We thoroughly evaluate our approach using both synthetic and
    real-world datasets across different domains, and analyze the
    empirical variations when applying our method to inherently
    different networks in practice. In addition, the heuristics on how
    the quality and quantity of the seed set would affect the
    performance are provided.

    The Continuation of Invariant Subspaces (CIS) algorithm produces a
    smoothly-varying basis for an invariant subspace R(s) of a
    parameter-dependent matrix $A(s)$. We have incorporated the CIS
    algorithm into `Cl_matcont`, a Matlab package for the study of
    dynamical systems and their bifurcations. Using subspace reduction, we
    extend the functionality of `Cl_matcont` to large-scale computations
    of bifurcations of equilibria. In this paper, we describe the
    algorithms and functionality of the resulting Matlab bifurcation
    package `Cl_matcontL`. The novel features include: new CIS-based,
    continuous, well-scaled test functions for codimension 1 and 2
    bifurcations; detailed description of locators for large problems; and
    examples of bifurcation analysis in large sparse problems.

    Solid-wave gyroscopes are symmetric resonators that sense rotation by
    measuring how Coriolis forces perturb a degenerate mode pair. The

    identical oscillators coupled by a perturbation due to rotation. In
    miniaturized solid-wave gyroscopes, geometric distortions due to
    imperfect fabrication also perturb the dynamics, and this limits
    sensing accuracy. In this work, we describe how geometric
    imperfections affect the dynamics of solid-wave gyroscopes. We also
    use selection rules both to find qualitative information about what
    types of geometry perturbations most affect sensor performance and to
    accelerate computations

    Scaling iterative graph processing applications to large graphs is an
    important problem. Performance is critical, as data scientists need to
    execute graph programs many times with varying parameters. The need
    for a high-level, high-performance programming model has inspired much
    research on graph programming frameworks. In this paper, we show that
    the important class of computationally light graph applications –
    applications that perform little computation per vertex – has severe
    scalability problems across multiple cores as these applications hit
    an early "memory wall" that limits their speedup. We propose a novel
    block-oriented computation model, in which computation is iterated
    locally over blocks of highly connected nodes, significantly improving
    the amount of computation per cache miss. Following this model, we
    describe the design and implementation of a block-aware graph
    processing runtime that keeps the familiar vertex-centric programming
    paradigm while reaping the benefits of block-oriented execution. Our
    experiments show that block-oriented execution significantly improves
    the performance of our framework for several graph applications.

    Scientists are currently evaluating the cloud as a new platform. Many
    important scientific applications, however, perform poorly in the
    cloud. These applications proceed in highly parallel discrete
    time-steps or "ticks," using logical synchronization barriers at tick
    boundaries. We observe that network jitter in the cloud can severely
    increase the time required for communication in these applications,
    significantly increasing overall running time.

    In this paper, we propose a general parallel framework to process
    time-stepped applications in the cloud. Our framework exposes a
    high-level, data-centric programming model which represents
    application state as tables and dependencies between states as queries
    over these tables. We design a jitter-tolerant runtime that uses these
    data dependencies to absorb latency spikes by (1) carefully scheduling
    computation and (2) replicating data and computation. Our data-driven
    approach is transparent to the scientist and requires little
    additional code. Our experiments show that our methods improve
    performance up to a factor of three for several typical time-stepped
    applications.

    A long-standing line of work in economic theory has studied models by
    which a group of people in a social network, each holding a numerical

    consensus is rarely reached in real opinion dynamics, we study a
    related sociological model in which individuals' intrinsic beliefs
    counterbalance the averaging process and yield a diversity of

    dynamics in an underlying game with natural payoffs, and the limit of
    the process as an equilibrium, we are able to study the cost of
    disagreement in these models relative to a social optimum. We provide
    a tight bound on the cost at equilibrium relative to the optimum, our
    analysis draws a connection between these agreement models and
    extremal problems for generalized eigenvalues. We also consider a
    natural network design problem in this setting, where adding links to
    the underlying network can reduce the cost of disagreement at

    Internet fault diagnosis is extremely important for end-users, overlay
    network service providers (like Akamai ), and even Internet service
    providers (ISPs). However, because link-level properties cannot be
    uniquely determined from end-to-end measurements, the accuracy of
    existing statistical diagnosis approaches is subject to uncertainty
    from statistical assumptions about the network. In this paper, we
    propose a novel least-biased end-to-end network diagnosis (in short,
    LEND) system for inferring link-level properties like loss rate. We
    define a minimal identifiable link sequence (MILS) as a link sequence
    of minimal length whose properties can be uniquely identified from
    end-to-end measurements. We also design efficient algorithms to find
    all the MILSs and infer their loss rates for diagnosis. Our LEND
    system works for any network topology and for both directed and
    undirected properties and incrementally adapts to network topology and
    property changes. It gives highly accurate estimates of the loss rates
    of MILSs, as indicated by both extensive simulations and Internet
    experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such diagnosis can be
    achieved with fine granularity and in near real-time even for
    reasonably large overlay networks. Finally, LEND can supplement
    existing statistical inference approaches and provide smooth tradeoff
    between diagnosis accuracy and granularity.

    Overlay network monitoring enables distributed Internet applications
    to detect and recover from path outages and periods of degraded
    performance within seconds. For an overlay network with end hosts,
    existing systems either require measurements, and thus lack
    scalability, or can only estimate the latency but not congestion or
    failures. Our earlier extended abstract [Y. Chen, D. Bindel, and R. H.
    Katz, "Tomography-based overlay network monitoring," Proceedings of
    the ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2003] briefly
    proposes an algebraic approach that selectively monitors linearly
    independent paths that can fully describe all the paths. The loss
    rates and latency of these paths can be used to estimate the loss
    rates and latency of all other paths. Our scheme only assumes
    knowledge of the underlying IP topology, with links dynamically
    varying between lossy and normal. In this paper, we improve,
    implement, and extensively evaluate such a monitoring system. We
    further make the following contributions: i) scalability analysis
    indicating that for reasonably large n (e.g., 100), the growth of $k$
    is bounded as $O(n \log n)$, ii) efficient adaptation algorithms for
    topology changes, such as the addition or removal of end hosts and
    routing changes, iii) measurement load balancing schemes, iv) topology
    measurement error handling, and v) design and implementation of an
    adaptive streaming media system as a representative application. Both
    simulation and Internet experiments demonstrate we obtain highly
    accurate path loss rate estimation while adapting to topology changes
    within seconds and handling topology errors.

    For interactive sound synthesis, we would like to change the shape of

    modal decomposition with each change in the geometry, making the
    analysis too slow for interactive use. However, by using modes
    computed for one geometry to estimate the frequencies for nearby
    geometries, we can hear much more quickly how changing the instrument
    shape changes the sound. In this paper, we describe how to estimate
    resonant frequencies of an instrument by combining information about
    the modes of two similar instruments. We also describe the balance
    between computational speed and accuracy of the computed resonances.

    In the last decade, many researchers have used modal synthesis for
    sound generation. Using a modal decomposition, one can convert a large
    system of coupled differential equations into simple, independent
    differential equations in one variable. To synthesize sound from the
    system, one solves these decoupled equations numerically, which is
    much more efficient than solving the original coupled system. For
    large systems, such as those obtained from finite-element analysis of
    a musical instrument, the initial modal decomposition is
    time-consuming. To design instruments from physical simulation, one
    would like to be able to compute modes in real-time, so that the
    geometry, and therefore spectrum, of an instrument can be changed
    interactively. In this paper, we describe how to quickly compute modes
    of instruments which have rotational symmetry in order to synthesize
    sounds of new instruments quickly enough for interactive instrument
    design.

    This dissertation is about computational tools to aid in the design
    of resonant Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), tiny vibrating
    devices built by processes like those used to make integrated
    circuits. Vibrating MEMS are used in accelerometers and gyroscopes,
    in sensors to detect chemicals and to measure pressure, and in
    communication devices such as cell phones. MEMS engineers can use
    computer simulations to design devices using fewer costly and
    time-consuming prototype tests, but these simulations are only as
    useful as the models on which they are built. In this work, we
    contribute new mathematical models, numerical methods, and software
    tools to simulate resonant MEMS, and apply these tools to analyze
    specific devices. We describe physical models of damped vibrations
    of MEMS, including anchor loss and thermoelastic effects which are
    widely recognized as important, but not modeled in generality by
    existing tools. Though the resulting systems of equations are large
    and non-Hermitian, and depend nonlinearly on frequency, we use the
    equation structure to develop efficient structured Krylov subspace
    projection methods for computing free vibrations and reduced-order
    models. We also provide efficient continuation methods for
    re-computing eigendecompositions under changes to design parameters
    or operating conditions. Our models and analysis methods are
    integrated into HiQLab, a new finite element tool with a
    particularly flexible architecture which we have designed. Using
    HiQLab, we simulate example resonator designs, and compare our
    results to laboratory measurements. Our simulations reveal a
    previously-unknown mode interference phenomenon, subsequently
    observed in experiments, which dramatically affects the amount of
    damping near certain critical values of geometric parameters.

    better numerical methods, memory hierarchy optimizations, parallelism,
    and automatic performance tuning to accommodate new architectures;
    More accurate algorithms, including better numerical methods, and use
    of extra precision; Expanded functionality, including updating and
    downdating, new eigenproblems, etc. and putting more of LAPACK into
    ScaLAPACK; Improved ease of use, e.g., via friendlier interfaces in
    multiple languages. To accomplish these goals we are also relying on
    better software engineering techniques and contributions from
    collaborators at many institutions.

    Internet fault diagnosis is extremely important for end users, overlay
    network service providers (like Akamai [1]) and even Internet service
    providers (ISPs). However, because link-level properties cannot be
    uniquely determined from end-to-end measurements, the accuracy of
    existing statistical diagnosis approaches is subject to uncertainty
    from statistical assumptions about the network. In this paper, we
    propose a novel *Least-biased End-to-end Network Diagnosis* (in short,
    LEND) system for inferring link-level properties like loss rate. We
    define a *minimal identifiable link sequence* (MILS) as a link sequence
    of minimal length whose properties can be uniquely identified from
    end-to-end measurements. We also design efficient algorithms to find
    all the MILSes and infer their loss rates for diagnosis. Our LEND
    system works for any network topology and for both directed and
    undirected properties, and incrementally adapts to network topology
    and property changes. It gives highly accurate estimates of the loss
    rates of MILSes, as indicated by both extensive simulations and
    Internet experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such diagnosis
    can be achieved with fine granularity and in near real-time even for
    reasonably large overlay networks. Finally, LEND can supplement
    existing statistical inference approaches and provide smooth tradeoff
    between diagnosis accuracy and granularity.

    We summarize an algorithm for computing a smooth orthonormal basis for
    an invariant subspace of a parameter-dependent matrix, and describe
    how to extend it for numerical bifurcation analysis. We adapt the
    continued subspace to track behavior relevant to bifurcations, and use
    projection methods to deal with large problems. To test our ideas, we
    have integrated our code into MATCONT, a program for numerical
    continuation and bifurcation analysis.

    This paper presents the development of HiQLab, a simulation tool to
    compute the effect of damping in high frequency resonators. Existing
    simulation tools allow designers to compute resonant frequencies but
    few tools provide estimates of damping, which is crucial in evaluating
    the performance of such devices. In the current code, two damping
    mechanisms: thermoelastic damping and anchor loss, have been
    implemented. Thermoelastic damping results from irreversible heat flow
    due to mechanically-driven temperature gradients, while anchor loss
    occurs when high-frequency mechanical waves radiate away from the
    resonator and into the substrate. Our finite-element simulation tool
    discretizes PDE models of both phenomena, and evaluates the quality
    factor ($Q$), a measure of damping in the system, with specialized
    eigencomputations and model reduction techniques. The core functions
    of the tool are written in C++ for performance. Interfaces are in Lua
    and MATLAB, which give users access to powerful visualization and pre-
    and postprocessing capabilities.

    Electromechanical resonators and filters, such as quartz, ceramic, and
    surface-acoustic wave devices, are important signal-processing
    elements in communication systems. Over the past decade, there has
    been substantial progress in developing new types of miniaturized
    electromechanical resonators using microfabrication processes. For
    these micro-resonators to be viable they must have high and
    predictable quality factors ($Q$). Depending on scale and geometry, the
    energy losses that lower $Q$ may come from material damping,
    thermoelastic damping, air damping, or radiation of elastic waves from
    an anchor. Of these factors, anchor losses are the least understood
    because such losses are due to a complex radiation phenomena in a
    semi-infinite elastic half-space. Here, we describe how anchor losses
    can be accurately computed using an absorbing boundary based on a
    *perfectly matched layer* (PML) which absorbs incoming waves over a wide
    frequency range for any non-zero angle of incidence. We exploit the
    interpretation of the PML as a complex-valued change of coordinates
    to illustrate how one can come to a simpler finite element
    implementation than was given in its original presentations. We also
    examine the convergence and accuracy of the method, and give
    guidelines for how to choose the parameters effectively. As an example
    application, we compute the anchor loss in a micro disk resonator and
    compare it to experimental data. Our analysis illustrates a surprising
    mode-mixing phenomenon which can substantially affect the quality of
    resonance.

    The Continuation of Invariant Subspaces (CIS) algorithm produces a
    smoothly varying basis for an invariant subspace $R(s)$ of a
    parameter-dependent matrix $A(s)$. In the case when $A(s)$ is the
    Jacobian matrix for a system that comes from a spatial discretization
    of a partial differential equation, it will typically be large and
    sparse. `Cl_matcont` is a user-friendly MATLAB package for the study
    of dynamical systems and their bifurcations. We incorporate the CIS
    algorithm into `Cl_matcont` to extend its functionality to large scale
    bifurcation computations via subspace reduction

    We consider the set of matrices which differ from symmetric, skew
    symmetric, or unitary by only a low rank modification. This class of
    matrices includes companion matrices, arrow matrices, and matrices
    corresponding to mechanical oscillators with localized damping. We
    show that Hessenberg and Schur forms for such matrices have
    semi-separable structure, and we use this fact to construct a
    backward stable eigensolver for such matrices which requires $O(n)$
    space and runs in $O(n^2)$ time. We evaluate the performance and
    accuracy of our approach for several test problems, including the
    computation of all the roots of a polynomial or a matrix polynomial.

    Surface-micromachined resonators and filters are attractive for many
    RF applications. While existing simulation tools allow designers to
    compute resonant frequencies, few tools provide estimates of the
    damping in these devices. This paper reports on a new tool that allows
    designers, for the first time, to compute anchor losses in
    high-frequency resonators and account for sub-surface scatterers. By
    exercising the tool on a family of radially driven disk resonators, we
    show that the anchor loss mechanism for this class of devices involves
    a parasitic mixed-mode bending action that pumps energy into the
    substrate. Further, using the tool, we predict a large variation in
    resonator quality depending upon film thickness. Our simulation shows
    that the source of this variation is a complex radial-to-bending
    motion interaction, which we visualize with a root-locus diagram. We
    experimentally verify this predicted sensitivity using poly-SiGe disk
    resonators having $Q$'s ranging from 200 to 54,000.

    Overlay network monitoring enables distributed Internet applications
    to detect and recover from path outages and periods of degraded
    performance within seconds. For an overlay network with $n$ end hosts,
    existing systems either require $O(n^2)$ measurements, and thus lack
    scalability, or can only estimate the latency but not congestion or
    failures. Our earlier extended abstract briefly proposes an
    algebraic approach that selectively monitors $k$ linearly independent
    paths that can fully describe all the $O(n^2)$ paths. The loss rates and
    latency of these $k$ paths can be used to estimate the loss rates and
    latency of all other paths. Our scheme only assumes knowledge of the
    underlying IP topology, with links dynamically varying between lossy
    and normal.In this paper, we improve, implement and extensively
    evaluate such a monitoring system. We further make the following
    contributions: i) scalability analysis indicating that for reasonably
    large n (e.g., 100), the growth of $k$ is bounded as $O(n \log n)$, ii)
    efficient adaptation algorithms for topology changes, such as the
    addition or removal of end hosts and routing changes, iii) measurement
    load balancing schemes, and iv) topology measurement error handling.
    Both simulation and Internet experiments demonstrate we obtain highly
    accurate path loss rate estimation while adapting to topology changes
    within seconds and handling topology errors.

    We consider the efficient and accurate computation of Givens
    rotations. When $f$ and $g$ are positive real numbers, this simply amounts
    to computing the values of $c = f/\sqrt{f^2 + g^2}$,
    $s = g/\sqrt{f^2 + g^2}$, and $r = \sqrt{f^2 + g^2}$.
    This apparently trivial computation merits closer consideration
    for the following three reasons. First, while the definitions of $c$, $s$
    and $r$ seem obvious in the case of two nonnegative arguments $f$ and $g$,
    there is enough freedom of choice when one or more of $f$ and $g$ are
    negative, zero or complex that LAPACK auxiliary routines SLARTG,
    CLARTG, SLARGV and CLARGV can compute rather different values of $c$, $s$
    and $r$ for mathematically identical values of $f$ and $g$. To eliminate
    this unnecessary ambiguity, the BLAS Technical Forum chose a single
    consistent definition of Givens rotations that we will justify here.
    Second, computing accurate values of $c$, $s$ and $r$ as efficiently as
    possible and reliably despite over/underflow is surprisingly
    complicated. For complex Givens rotations, the most efficient formulas
    require only one real square root and one real divide (as well as
    several much cheaper additions and multiplications), but a reliable
    implementation using only working precision has a number of cases. On
    a Sun Ultra-10, the new implementation is slightly faster than the
    previous LAPACK implementation in the most common case, and 2.7 to 4.6
    times faster than the corresponding vendor, reference or ATLAS
    routines. It is also more reliable; all previous codes occasionally
    suffer from large inaccuracies due to over/underflow. For real Givens
    rotations, there are also improvements in speed and accuracy, though
    not as striking. Third, the design process that led to this reliable
    implementation is quite systematic, and could be applied to the design
    of similarly reliable subroutines.
