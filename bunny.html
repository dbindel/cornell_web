  <!-- Story -->
  <div class="span4">
    <p>
      Around 2003, while I was a graduate student at Berkeley,
      my flatmate Patxi stuck his head in my door and said
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dave, what's a manifold?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So, I told him a bit about differentiable manifolds
      and their many uses.  The next day, he said
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I told Ushnish that I asked you what a manifold was.
      And Ushnish laughed, and said &quot;I'll bet he told you, didn't
      he!&quot;  You know that I thought you were going to say
      something about cars, right?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And a day or two after that, I got this picture of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong_(rabbit)">Oolong
      the rabbit</a> from Patxi.  I put it on my door.  It came down
      when I moved, but it has made periodic reappearances on my
      office doors ever since.
