  I took over as director of Cornell's Center for Applied Mathematics (CAM)
  on July 1, 2020. With a lot going on at Cornell and in the world, I got
  into the habit of sending out regular emails. Sometimes, I include a
  <q>sermon</q> at the end of the message.  It's an idea that I happily borrowed
  from Prof Sandy Mack, who ran the Honors Program at UMD when I was an
  undergrad, and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060515153721/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dbindel/sermons.html">sent out such sermons</a>.
