## Cornell students

Working with Cornell students on research projects is part of my job, and I am
likely very happy to talk to you about research!  In general, you should feel
free to send me email or (even better) come by my office during open office
hours.  We also welcome visitors at [group meetings](group.html).

### Undergrads and MEng students

My students work primarily on a mix of numerical algorithms, physics problems,
and data science problems.  We welcome undergraduate and MEng students who want
to work with us! Ideally, we will find a project that is interesting both to
you and to one of the graduate students in the group, so that you can get
multiple sources of guidance. If you want to learn more about what we do, you
can swing by our group meetings. Or send me an email, or stop by my
[office hours](hours.html)

Students can get credit for research via CS 4999 (undergraduate independent
study credits) or CS 5999 (MEng project credits) depending on whether they are
undergraduates or masters students.  Alternately, there *may* be opportunities
to work with me on research for pay, depending on the project, person, and
timing.

### PhD students

I am happy to talk to you about being a primary advisor, though I usually only
have time and funding to serve as primary advisor for a few PhD students at a
time.

I am also happy to talk to you if I'm not your advisor and you are doing
something numerical where I might be able to provide pointers!  In the past,
these types of questions have led to all sorts of outcomes: sometimes I just
give a pointer, sometimes a joint paper comes out of the conversation, and
sometimes I end up as an effective co-advisor. 

I am generally willing to serve as a member of a special committee for Cornell
PhD students if there is some reason why my expertise would be particularly
useful. At Cornell, I can represent the graduate fields of computer science,
math, applied math, civil engineering, data science, and computational science
and engineering.  I *am* on a lot of committees, so if there is someone else
who would be an equally good committee member, do consider asking them instead.

## Prospective PhD students

If you are applying to Cornell and think you might want to work with me,
feel free to drop me a line -- but please don't get put off if I don't
respond quickly, as my email sometimes gets out of hand!  I am most likely
to respond to direct questions and to queries directly about my research
area.

## Outside students

When I receive questions in my general research area, I try to make a
good faith attempt to answer them.  Please don't be offended if you write
and don't get a response -- I am likely just behind on email.

In the interest of being able to offer opportunities to Cornell students,
I usually cannot accommodate cold-call requests for internships or projects
from students from other universities (or high schools).
